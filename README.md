## Getting Started

Usage:

```
npx @sui-tyan/create-express-ts
```

after running this just change directory to your project and do:

```
yarn / yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

#### Note

Path aliases are already configured on the tsconfig.json through `tsconfig-paths` and `tsc-alias`
(no need to worry about path aliases on build).

If you want to improve this just do a PR
